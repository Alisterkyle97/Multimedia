## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Alisterkyle97/multimedia/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown filesssssssss.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

For my UI design, I chose to use both Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.
Adobe Illustrator was used to create specific buttons such as the home button and account button. I chose to use Illustrator for this task as Illustrator has powerful tools to manipulate shapes which meant I could create objects which looked how I had envisioned them.
I was able to manipulate objects using anchor points and curve tools, and combine multiple objects with each other using the pathfinder tool. I particularly had to use the pathfinder tool to create a cog which I used as the settings button. I made this by creating a star with many points and manipulating it with the use of another circle.

Adobe Photoshop was used to construct my wireframes and mock ups, integrating the objects I created in Illustrator. I chose Photoshop because it is the program I had the most experience with, and it has powerful creativity tools which meant I could give certain objects the look I desired. An example of this would be the ‘login’, ‘sign up’ and ‘search’ buttons that I created. I used effects such as an inner shadow, gradient overlay and drop shadow to give the buttons an almost realistic 3D look.
I also styled the logo I created in Photoshop. I styled this very basically using an arc tool, but in hindsight, if I was creating an application for a client or designing a logo for a client, I would have styled it much more and possibly have incorporated Illustrator.
