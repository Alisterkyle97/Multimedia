# UI Design

### Tools

For my UI design, I chose to use both Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.
Adobe Illustrator was used to create specific buttons such as the home button and account button. I chose to use Illustrator for this task as Illustrator has powerful tools to manipulate shapes which meant I could create objects which looked how I had envisioned them.
I was able to manipulate objects using anchor points and curve tools, and combine multiple objects with each other using the pathfinder tool. I particularly had to use the pathfinder tool to create a cog which I used as the settings button. I made this by creating a star with many points and manipulating it with the use of another circle.

Adobe Photoshop was used to construct my wireframes and mock ups, integrating the objects I created in Illustrator. I chose Photoshop because it is the program I had the most experience with, and it has powerful creativity tools which meant I could give certain objects the look I desired. An example of this would be the ‘login’, ‘sign up’ and ‘search’ buttons that I created. I used effects such as an inner shadow, gradient overlay and drop shadow to give the buttons an almost realistic 3D look.
I also styled the logo I created in Photoshop. I styled this very basically using an arc tool, but in hindsight, if I was creating an application for a client or designing a logo for a client, I would have styled it much more and possibly have incorporated Illustrator.

### Asset management

I was able to easily manage my assets for this project just within Windows Explorer. The file sizes were not too large and I was able to store everything locally without the need for such services as cloud storage. 

To keep everything in one place, I have a folder in My Documents named “Multimedia”. Within this folder, I created a subfolder called “UI” as I knew this was the only UI project I was working on. Within the UI folder, I created two subfolders, one for each tool I used. I then saved each original project file, an exported copy of the project file, and any other resources in the appropriate folders.

After all my artboards were complete, I chose to export them all to JPEG. Typically if I was sending this as a document to a client, I would export to PDF, but because this was to be deployed on the web with images being viewable, I chose to export to JPEG, which was then uploaded to an image hosting site and then embedded on my website.

### Research and design decisions

When I started envisioning an idea of how my UI would look, I soon discovered that it was different to similar existing applications. Typically I am used to a navbar at the top of the screen, but the multiple applications I looked at all contained the navbar at the bottom. This influenced my placement of my navbar, as I wanted to stay consistent with what has already been developed. I also noted the main colour pallet of existing applications included brighter colours such as blues, yellows, oranges, along with some neutral whites and greys.

### Thoughts and decisions

I believe I was competent at using the tools I had chosen. I was able to distinguish what tool performed which task the best, and used the tool in a way that produced a result I was happy with. The tools I used are both industry standard tools which provides confidence that real world graphic designers and the like, use these tools on a daily basis.

These existing apps influenced my colour choice and I decided to go mainly with orange and grey. I chose these colours as orange is a nice bright, vivid colour which complimented the grey while giving good contrast against it. Going with this rather neutral colour pallet, I found when I added the banner at the bottom of my search page, and the hotel banners on the results page, it drew the eye to those vibrant colours. Designing a travel app, you want customers to make bookings, using the vivid colours for objects directly related to bookings may entice more customers to book, or at least focus their attention that way.

I also decided to make important components large. This includes both the login and sign up button on the first screen, the ‘search’ button on the second screen and the hotel details on the third page. This is so they catch the eye and become the centre of attention.
On my hotel details, I chose to include selling points in green. Green contrasts well with grey and I feel it complements the orange, but being the only green on the page, it pops out at you.

I have chosen to keep most things square and tried to space objects out evenly, while keeping the things I want in focus at the centre. I believe with the size and layout of components, and additionally the colour, it will draw the user’s eyes to what I would like them to see.


### Final layout

Below are the three screens I designed

### Final thoughts

Overall, my application was intended to be a minimalistic hotel booking app. I found a lot of current applications include a lot of unnecessary items which don’t appeal to frequent travellers or people travelling for business. They want to find a hotel, know what they’re getting and for what price, which is all shown on one screen.

If I was to do this again, I would explore different colour options, maybe incorporating some yellows and blues. Additionally you could add an animation effect onto buttons when pushed to really emphasise the 3D look
